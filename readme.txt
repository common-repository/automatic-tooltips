Automatically add tooltips to your post content based on keywords and their definitions configured in the back-end.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to automatically generate tooltips in the content of your posts, pages, and custom post types. Specifically, the plugin applies the tooltips on the fly based on the keywords defined in the back-end.

Automatic Tooltips is ideal to describe words that the user may not fully understand. For example, in a blog targeted at web developers, you can create a tooltip on the "Interaction Design" phrase to provide additional information about this UI Design term.

### How the plugin works

Technically the plugin uses regular expressions to find occurrences of the keywords in your posts. More precisely, the plugin executes these regular expressions each time a user visits a post.

It's important to note that the plugin does not alter the content of your posts. Instead, it uses a WordPress filter to add the HTML attributes used to generate the tooltip.

The plugin is versatile and suitable to be used with any language. You can even control advanced regular expression parameters from the plugin settings. For example, when you configure a new tooltip, you have the ability to:

* Create a case sensitive or case insensitive search of the keyword
* Define specific left and right boundaries for the keyword. For example, in English-like languages, you can decide to find only keywords separated by a whitespace character.
* Match keywords that are preceded or followed by specific characters.
* Limit the number of matches of the keyword in the same post. For example, you can use this option to add the tooltips only on the first occurrence of a keyword.
* Set a priority value to determine which keyword should have priority over the others when there is a limit on the overall number of tooltips of the post.

### Notable features

#### Tooltips statistics
The plugin comes with a dedicated tooltips statistics menu. Here you can find the exact number of tooltips generated by the plugin in each post of your website. Use this information to monitor and configure the automatic tooltip of your website.

#### Customizable style
We have included 22 style customization options so you can create a custom look for your tooltips. In this section, you can set the typography of the tooltips, define the tooltips width, set the tooltips border radius, set the text decoration applied to the keywords that activate the tooltips, and more.

#### Ability to target specific post types, categories, and tags
The plugin gives you the ability to apply the tooltips only in specific post types, categories, or tags. This feature allows you, for example, to use the automatic tooltips only in the blog articles, to create distinct sets of automatic tooltips for different sections of the website, and more.
